### [B-02] Deep Unsupervised Drum Transcription | [paper](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000020.pdf) | [code](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/DrummerNet)

[Keunwoo Choi](https://keunwoochoi.wordpress.com); [Kyunghyun Cho](http://www.kyunghyuncho.me)
> "DrummerNet is a drum transcriber trained in an unsupervised fashion. DrummerNet learns to transcribe by learning to reconstruct the audio with the transcription estimate. Unsupervised learning + a large dataset allow DrummerNet to be less-biased."

### [L-06] Tools for Semi-Automatic Bounding Box Annotation of Musical Measures in Sheet Music | [paper](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/latebreaking/000006.pdf) | [web](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/2019-ISMIR-LBD-Measures)

> "In score following, one main goal is to highlight measure positions in sheet music synchronously to audio playback. Such applications require alignments between sheet music and audio representations. Often, such alignments can be computed automatically in the case that the sheet music representations are given in some symbolically encoded music format. However, sheet music is often available only in the form of digitized scans. In this case, the automated computation of accurate alignments poses still many challenges [1]. In this contribution, we present various semi-automatic tools for solving the subtask of determining bounding boxes (given in pixels) of measure positions in digital scans of sheet music—a task that is extremely tedious when being done manually."

### [L-10] Creating a Tool for Faciltiating and Researching Human Annotation of Musical Patterns | [paper](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/latebreaking/000010.pdf) | [code](https://github.com/StephanWells/ANOMIC)

[Stephan Wells](); [Iris Yuping Ren](http://irisryp.me/); [Anja Volk](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~fleis102/)
> "Musical patterns (repeated segments of music) are highly widespread in all varieties of music, and annotations of such patterns are valuable in many areas of music information retrieval. Unfortunately, there is a lack of expert annotations of musical patterns, and most annotation is done by hand. In this project, we introduce a novel software, ANOMIC, designed for users to intuitively annotate repeated musical segments, and we perform a user study which yields a large database of annotations done using the tool. We find that the tool’s reception was strongly positive and show that the annotations done with it reach high levels of inter-annotator agreement compared to traditional approaches."
